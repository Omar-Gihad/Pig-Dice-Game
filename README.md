# Pig Dice Game

This is a simple, fun, two-player dice game called "Pig Game" built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach 100 points. Players take turns to roll a dice, and their score is added to their current score unless they roll a 1, which resets their current score to 0. A player can choose to hold their score at any time, adding their current score to their total score and passing the turn to the other player.
